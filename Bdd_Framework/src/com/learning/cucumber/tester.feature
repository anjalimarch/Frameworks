In order to get good salary 
As a IT guy
I want to keep my boss happy.

Given I am a "bad" tester
When i go to work 
Then i "mess" it 
And My boss "fires" me
But the developer "likes" me


Scenario:I am a good tester.
Given I am a "good" tester
When i go to work 
Then i "complete" it 
And My boss "salutes" me
But the developer "hates" me
